Problem 1: Cycle finding
As part of this problem, you have to design and implement an algorithm to find a cycle (just one cycle) in an undirected graph. Specific tasks you have to accomplish are:

Design a correct algorithm and show it in pseudo-code
Provide proof of the algorithm's correctness
Find and prove the algorithm's running time
Implement the algorithm in a compiled language and: 
  - Write a graph generator (Hint: use an existing graph generation library if you can)
  - Write test code to validate that the algorithm finds cycles
  - Test the algorithm for increasing graph sizes.
  - Plot the running time as a function of size to verify that the asymptotic complexity in step 3 matches experiments 
Note: you cannot assume that the graph is connected.



Problem 2:  Minimum Spanning Tree for "sparse" graphs
For this problem, we consider undirected graphs that have n nodes and at most n+8 edges. For these graphs, you have to design an efficient algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree.

Design a correct algorithm and show it in pseudo-code 
Provide proof of the algorithm's correctness 
Find and prove the algorithm's running time 
Implement the algorithm in a compiled language and: 
  - Write a graph generator (Hint: use an existing graph generation library if you can)
  - Write test code to validate that the algorithm finds a spanning tree
  - Test the algorithm for increasing graph sizes.
  - Plot the running time as a function of size to verify that the asymptotic complexity in step 3 matches experiments
